# CPE646_Project
## Live Memetic Detection
Final class project where we trained a R-CNN using Tensorflow's Object Detection API to detect memetic imagery on webpage feeds using a livestream capture. The CNN model was able to discriminate between the memetic images and similar images such ads and user generated content without memtic subtext. We gathered and labeled our own library of images for training and even built our own CNN model as a proof-of-concept. The Jupyter Notebook in this project is that proof-of-concept posted for anyone interested in the application and a starting point to further develop an improved model. We did not upload the rest of the Object Detection project because the actual project size and corpus of collected data is too large for Github.
